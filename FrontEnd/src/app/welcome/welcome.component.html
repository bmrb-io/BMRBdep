      <p>BMRbig is a BMRB project designed to accommodate the acquisition of diverse data (not just NMR data)
        beyond the types currently curated and annotated by BMRB. Uploading to BMRbig is simpler than deposition
        in BMRB, but serves as a potential intermediate step toward a full BMRB deposition. Data uploads to
        BMRbig will be “write once”, although submissions may be augmented at a later time. The expectation
        is that data uploaded to BMRbig will become publicly accessible, within 6 months or less of the time
        of upload. BMRbig will provide persistent links to uploaded data.</p>
      <p>BMRbig IDs are separate from BMRB IDs and are <b>not equivalent</b>. To switch to the BMRBdep deposition system
      which assigns complete BMRB IDs, please proceed to <a href="https://deposit.bmrb.io">BMRBdep</a>.</p>
