Less time on reddit! Ugh me too. Its all good, I've been super busy moving anyway.

I think I mentioned I just went through Madison to La Crosse this past weekend. I may be
trading in my car soon, so I'd have to go through again. Guess I could keep you guys posted if we click!

Metric is one of my absolute favorites, yes. I can't name my favorite Metric album...I
 really adore them all. Eels Souljacker album is super good, along with Wonderful, Glorious.
  Eels are in quite a few movie soundtracks as well. If you like Broken Social Scene and
   Metric, you should also check out Stars. More awesome Canadians! The album No One is
    Lost is my fave there.

I think I've heard of Fruit Bats. Any good songs I should listen to? A show would be fun,
 although I'd be down to meet for coffee or something sooner with you and your wife. I 
 have a few favorite Madison restaurants as well...Swagat and Ha Long Bay come to mind.
  Any thoughts on good eats?

What do you and Amy do? I teach, as you probably read!

Board games are always a solid choice in my book... I'll play cards and dominoes too. 
Which games do you guys enjoy? Some favorites for me would be Dominion and Kingdom Builder.
 I also like cute little card games like Sushi Go!-->
